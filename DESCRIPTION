Description: Implements a dynamic prediction framework combining landmark analysis
    with Principal Analysis by Conditional Expectation (PACE) to more accurately
    impute irregularly measured continuous time-varying covariates. Provides
    modeling approaches for both dynamic Cox and dynamic RMST models and
    generates personalized dynamic risk prediction curves for individual
    patients based on the fitted models.
